- Feel free to use and modify it for your class assignments :) .
- it takes in 2 values of Hex in format "0xfe" as an example.
- V2 also has a format checker to check if format inputed is correct.
- V2 also includes fornat correct if for example you type:
            - "0xf3pppppp" where "pppppp" is the undesired input
            - it will correct and only take it the Hex
- To avoid breaking the program with bad input.
- V2 is recommended alot of changes,input checker and nice output format.
